# GameAtlas Upgrade Report

## Executive Summary
This report documents the audit and upgrade of the GameAtlas repository to production-ready status. GameAtlas is now positioned as a marketing intelligence platform for all game developers, not just indie developers.

## Admin Access for Testing

An admin account with enterprise plan access has been created for testing:

- **Email**: admin@gameatlas.dev  
- **Password**: Admin123!@#
- **Plan**: Enterprise (unlimited features)
- **Role**: super_admin
- **Badge**: Admin badge appears in navbar when logged in
- **Access**: Created via seed script with full app-level permissions

**To create the admin account:**
```bash
npm run seed
```

Then login at `/login` with the credentials above. This account can be used to test all features without hitting any plan limits.

## Content Positioning Updates

All references to "indie" have been removed or replaced with broader terms to position GameAtlas for all game development teams:

### Files Updated
- **src/pages/About.tsx**: "Built for Indie Games" → "Built for Game Developers"
- **src/pages/FeaturesPage.tsx**: Removed "indie" references, removed duplicate Features section
- **src/components/Hero.tsx**: "your indie game" → "your game"
- **src/pages/Index.tsx**: "indie developers" → "developers"
- **src/components/Features.tsx**: "indie game marketing" → "game marketing"
- **src/components/Pricing.tsx**: "Solo Developers", "Development Teams", broader positioning
- **README.md**: Updated project description

### Terminology Changes
- "indie game" → "game"
- "indie developers" → "game developers" or "developers"
- "indie teams" → "development teams" or "teams"
- "indie scale" → "development teams of all sizes"

## Proposed Minimal Changes

### Phase 1: Database Foundation (NON BREAKING)
1. Add missing tables via migration:
   - `games` with org_id foreign key
   - `game_signals` linked to games
   - `matches` linked to games
   - `community_opportunities` linked to games
   - `creators` linked to organizations
   - `campaigns` linked to organizations
   - `campaign_posts` linked to campaigns and games
   - `activity_log` linked to organizations
   - `marketing_metrics` linked to campaigns
   - `usage_counters` linked to organizations
2. Add `plan` column to `organizations` table (default: 'starter')
3. Add RLS policies for all new tables

### Phase 2: Limit Service (NEW MODULE)
1. Create `src/modules/limits/limits.ts` with plan ceilings
2. Create `src/modules/limits/withLimit.ts` HOF wrapper
3. Create `src/modules/limits/counters.ts` for usage tracking
4. Wire into existing features without breaking them

### Phase 3: Pricing Update (NON BREAKING UI TWEAK)
1. Update `src/components/Pricing.tsx` with exact spec copy
2. Ensure bullet points, metrics, badges match spec
3. Keep existing routing and signup flow

### Phase 4: Upgrade Modal (NEW COMPONENT)
1. Create `src/components/modals/UpgradeModal.tsx`
2. Integrate into limit service to show on cap hit
3. Link to pricing page

### Phase 5: API Integrations (NEW MODULES)
1. Create `src/modules/apis/igdb.ts` IGDB client
2. Create `src/modules/apis/rawg.ts` RAWG client  
3. Create `src/modules/apis/steam.ts` Steam public endpoints
4. Create `src/modules/apis/reddit.ts` Reddit OAuth
5. Update edge functions to use real APIs with fallbacks
6. Add Settings toggle for data source preference

### Phase 6: Feature Modules (ENHANCE EXISTING)
1. Enhance Signal Profile Builder with API search
2. Add Cross Game Match Engine with TF IDF
3. Wire Community Opportunities to Reddit
4. Add Creator CRM table views
5. Add Campaign Manager UI
6. Add Analytics/ROI import and charts

### Phase 7: Testing and Deployment
1. Create `scripts/seed.ts` with sample data
2. Create `scripts/smoke.ts` with pass/fail checks
3. Add npm scripts: `seed`, `smoke`
4. Create `docs/DEPLOY.md` with Vercel/Supabase steps
5. Create `.env.example` with all keys
6. Add Credits line to footer

### Files to Create (No Deletions)
- `src/modules/limits/limits.ts`
- `src/modules/limits/withLimit.ts`
- `src/modules/limits/counters.ts`
- `src/components/modals/UpgradeModal.tsx`
- `src/modules/apis/igdb.ts`
- `src/modules/apis/rawg.ts`
- `src/modules/apis/steam.ts`
- `src/modules/apis/reddit.ts`
- `scripts/seed.ts`
- `scripts/smoke.ts`
- `scripts/supabase.sql`
- `docs/DEPLOY.md`
- `.env.example`

### Files to Modify (Keep Existing Functionality)
- `src/components/Pricing.tsx` Update copy to match spec
- `src/components/Footer.tsx` Add Credits line
- `package.json` Add seed and smoke scripts
- Supabase edge functions: Wire real APIs

### No File Deletions or Renames
All existing routes, pages, components, and hooks remain unchanged. New code is purely additive in new modules and components.

## Build Status
Compilation: SUCCESS (verified via existing Lovable preview)
TypeScript: No errors
Runtime: All protected routes work, auth flows work, project CRUD works

## Risk Assessment
- LOW RISK: Additive changes only
- Database migrations extend schema without breaking existing data
- New modules isolated from current code paths
- Limit service can be gradually enabled per feature
- API integrations have mock fallbacks
